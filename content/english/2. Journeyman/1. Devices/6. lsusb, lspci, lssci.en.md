# What command can be used to view usb devices?

> The lsusb command, also known as the “List USB” command, is used in Linux to list all the USB devices attached to the system. The lsusb command simply lists the connected devices and does not provide further information about the usb devices. For more information about the attached USB devices use the dmesg command.
