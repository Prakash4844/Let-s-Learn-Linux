## Lesson Content

What happens when you install a new kernel? Well it actually adds a couple of files to your system, these files are usually added to the /boot directory. 

You will see multiple files for different kernel versions:

* vmlinuz - this is the actual linux kernel
* initrd - as we've discussed before, the initrd is used as a temporary file system, used before loading the kernel
* System.map - symbolic lookup table
* config - kernel configuration settings, if you are compiling your own kernel, you can set which modules can be loaded



If your /boot directory runs out of space, you can always delete old versions of these files or just use a package manager, but be careful when doing maintenance in this directory and don't accidentally delete the kernel you are using.

## Exercise

Go into your boot directory and see what files are in there.
