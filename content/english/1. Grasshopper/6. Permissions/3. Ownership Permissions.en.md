## Lesson Content

In addition to modifying permissions on files, you can also modify the group and user ownership of the file as well. 

**Modify user ownership**

 ```bash
 $ sudo chown patty myfile 
 ```

This command will set the owner of myfile to patty.

**Modify group ownership**

 ```bash
 $ sudo chgrp whales myfile 
 ```

This command will set the group of myfile to whales.

**Modify both user and group ownership at the same time**
If you add a colon and groupname after the user you can set both the user and group at the same time.

 ```bash
 $ sudo chown patty:whales myfile 
 ``` 

## Exercise

Modify the group and user of some test files. Afterwards take a look at the permissions with ls -l.
