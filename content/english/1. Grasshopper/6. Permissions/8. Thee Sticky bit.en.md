## Lesson Content

One last special permission bit I want to talk about is the sticky bit. 

This permission bit, "sticks a file/directory" this means that only the owner or the root user can delete or modify the file. This is very useful for shared directories. Take a look at the example below:

```bash
$ ls -ld /tmp
drwxrwxrwxt 6 root root 4096 Dec 15 11:45 /tmp
```

You'll see a special permission bit at the end here **t</b>, this means everyone can add files, write files, modify files in the /tmp directory, but only root can delete the /tmp directory. 

**Modify sticky bit**

```bash
$ sudo chmod +t mydir

$ sudo chmod 1755 mydir
```

The numerical representation for the sticky bit is **1**

## Exercise
