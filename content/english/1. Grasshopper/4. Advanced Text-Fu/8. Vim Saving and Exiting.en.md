## Lesson Content

Now that you've done your editing it's time to actually save and quit out of vim: 

- :w - writes or saves the file 
- :q - quit out of vim 
- :wq - write and then quit 
- :q! - quit out of vim without saving the file 
- ZZ - equivalent of :wq, but one character faster 

- u - undo your last action 
- Ctrl-r - redo your last action 

You may not think ZZ is necessary, but you'll eventually see that your fingers may tend to lean towards this rather than :wq.
