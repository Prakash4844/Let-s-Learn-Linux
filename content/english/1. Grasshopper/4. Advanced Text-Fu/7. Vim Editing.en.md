## Lesson Content

Now that we have a couple of lines written, let's edit it a bit more and remove some cruft.

```
x - used to cut the selected text also used for deleting characters
dd - used to delete the current line
y - yank or copy whatever is selected
yy - yank or copy the current line
p - paste the copied text before the cursor
```

## Exercise

I know this lesson added some oddballs, open up a text editor and play around with these.

## Quiz Question
