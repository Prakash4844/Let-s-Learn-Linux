## Lesson Content

**To close out of emacs**

```bash
C-x C-c
```

If you have any open buffers, it will ask you to save it before closing out of emacs.

**Confused?**

```bash
C-h C-h : help menu
```

**Undo**

```bash
C-x u
```

As you can see Emacs has more moving parts, so the learning curve is a little steeper. In exchange though, you get a very powerful text editor.

## Quiz Question

# How do you access the help menu?

> Try ```C-h C-h``` ( 'help-for-help' ) to access Emacs help. You can also use the 'Help' menu. The EmacsManual is available through 'Help' → 'Info' → 'Emacs' . The command names associated with the individual help keys can sometimes help you remember the keys themselves.

1. [ ] C-h
2. [ ] C-help
3. [ ] help
4. [x] C-h C-h
