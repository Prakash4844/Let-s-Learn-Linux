# Lesson Content

The sort command is useful for sorting lines.

```bash
file1.txt
dog
cow

elephant
bird

$ sort file1.txt

You can also do a reverse sort: 

```bash
$ sort -r file1.txt
elephant
dog
cow
cat
bird
```

And also sort via numerical value: 

```bash
$ sort -n file1.txt
bird
cat
cow
elephant
dog
```
