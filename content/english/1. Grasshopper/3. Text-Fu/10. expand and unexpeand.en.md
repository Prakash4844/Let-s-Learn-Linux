## Lesson Content

In our lesson on the cut command, we had our sample.txt file that contained a tab. Normally TABs would usually show a noticeable difference but some text files don't show that well enough. Having TABs in a text file may not be the desired spacing you want. To change your TABs to spaces, use the expand command. 

```bash
$ expand sample.txt
```

The command above will print output with each TAB converted into a group of spaces. To save this output in a file, use output redirection like below.

```bash
$ expand sample.txt > result.txt
```

Opposite to expand, we can convert back each group of spaces to a TAB with the unexpand command: 

```bash
$ unexpand -a result.txt
```

## Exercise

What happens if you just type expand with no file input?
