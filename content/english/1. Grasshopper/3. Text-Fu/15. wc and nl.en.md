## Lesson Content

The wc (word count) command shows the total count of words in a file. 

```bash
$ wc /etc/passwd
 96     265    5925 /etc/passwd
```

It display the number of lines, number of words and number of bytes, respectively.

To just see just the count of a certain field, use the -l, -w, or -c respectively. 

```bash
$ wc -l /etc/passwd
96
```

Another command you can use to check the count of lines on a file is the nl (number lines) command. 

```bash
file1.txt
i
like
turtles
```

```bash
$ nl file1.txt
1. i
2. like
3. turtles
```

## Exercise

How would you get the total count of lines by using the nl file without searching through the entire output? Hint: Use some of the other commands you learned in this course.
