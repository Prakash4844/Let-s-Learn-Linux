## Lesson Content

The paste command is similar to the cat command, it merges lines together in a file. Let's create a new file with the following contents: 

```bash
sample2.txt
The
quick
brown
fox
```

Let's combine all these lines into one line: 

```bash
$ paste -s sample2.txt
```

The default delimiter for paste is TAB, so now there is one line with TABs separating each word.

Let's change this delimiter (-d) to something a little more readable: 

```bash
$ paste -d ' ' -s sample2.txt
```

Now everything should be on one line delimited by spaces.

## Exercise

Try to paste multiple files together, what happens?

## Quiz Question

# What flag do you use with paste to make everything go on one line? 

> Paste command is one of the useful commands in Unix or Linux operating system. It is used to join files horizontally (parallel merging) by outputting lines consisting of lines from each file specified, separated by tab as delimiter, to the standard output. When no file is specified, or put dash (“-“) instead of file name, paste reads from standard input and gives output as it is until a interrupt command [Ctrl-c] is given.
