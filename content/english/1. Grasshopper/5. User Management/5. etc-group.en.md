## Lesson Content

Another file that is used in user management is the /etc/group file. This file allows for different groups with different permissions. 

```bash
$ cat /etc/group

root:*:0:pete
```

Very similar to the /etc/password field, the /etc/group fields are as follows:

- Group name 
- Group password - there isn't a need to set a group password, using an elevated privilege like sudo is standard. A "*" will be put in place as the default value. 
- Group ID (GID) 
- List of users - you can manually specify users you want in a specific group 

## Exercise

Run the command **groups**. What do you see?
