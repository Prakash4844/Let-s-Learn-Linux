## Lesson Content

The ```/etc/shadow``` file is used to store information about user authentication. It requires superuser read permissions. 

```bash
$ sudo cat /etc/shadow

root:MyEPTEa$6Nonsense:15000:0:99999:7:::
```

You'll notice that it looks very similar to the contents of ```/etc/passwd```, however in the password field you'll see an encrypted password. The fields are separated by colons as followed:

- Username 
- Encrypted password 
- Date of last password changed - expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970. If there is a 0 that means the user should change their password the next time they login 
- Minimum password age - Days that a user will have to wait before being able to change their password again 
- Maximum password age - Maximum number of days before a user has to change their password 
- Password warning period - Number of days before a password is going to expire 
- Password inactivity period - Number of days after a password has expired to allow login with their password 
- Account expiration date - date that user will not be able to login 
- Reserved field for future use 

In most distributions today, user authentication doesn't rely on just the /etc/shadow file, there are other mechanisms in place such as PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) that replace authentication.
