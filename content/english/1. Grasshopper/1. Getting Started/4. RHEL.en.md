## Lesson Content

**Overview**
Red Hat Enterprise Linux commonly referred to as RHEL is developed by Red Hat. RHEL has strict rules to restrict free re-distribution although it still provides source code for free.

**Package Management**
RHEL uses a different package manager than Debian, RPM package manager, which we will eventually learn about as well.

**Configurability**
RHEL-based operating systems will differ slightly from the Debian-based operating systems, most noticeably in package management. If you decide to go with RHEL it’s probably best if you know you’ll be working with it.

**Uses**
As described by the name it's mostly used in enterprise, so if you need a solid server OS this would be a good one.
