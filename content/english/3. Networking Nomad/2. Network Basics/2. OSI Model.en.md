## Lesson Content

Before we can look at some practical networking stuff, we have to go over some boring jargon that you've probably heard of before. The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a theoretical model of networking. This model shows us how a packet traverses through a network in seven different layers. I won't get into specifics of this model, since most of these networking courses will be focused on the TCP/IP model, but it should be mentioned that such a theoretical networking model exists and has actually played a large part in the TCP/IP networking model that we use today.

## Quiz Question

# What is used as the theoretical model of networking?

> - The OSI model is a theoretical model for understanding the various components of data communications. However, today, most data communications use the TCP/IP model, which includes the same functions but does not outline the various communication layers as clearly as OSI

> - In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

1. [ ] TCP/IP
2. [x] OSI
